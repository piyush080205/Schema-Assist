#  Schema Assist

> Conversational Data Dictionary Agent for Relational Databases  
> Ask questions in plain English. Get SQL + interactive charts instantly.

##  What is Schema Assist?

Schema Assist transforms complex relational databases into a conversational analytics experience.

Instead of writing SQL, users can ask:

- “Show monthly order trends”
- “What’s the average delivery time?”
- “Top 5 cities by revenue?”

The system interprets intent, generates queries, and returns interactive charts powered by Plotly.

---

##  Why This Matters

Business users often struggle with:
- Writing SQL
- Understanding schema relationships
- Maintaining data dictionaries
- Creating meaningful visualizations

Schema Assist solves this by combining:
- LLM-powered intent parsing  
- Auto-maintained metadata layer  
- Dynamic query generation  
- Real-time visualization

##  Core Architecture

### 1️ LLM/NLP Engine  
Uses Cohere models for intent detection and embedding similarity.

### 2️ Metadata Layer  
Auto-maintained schema descriptions, relationships, and sample values.

### 3️ Query Generator  
Translates natural language → SQL or Pandas queries.

### 4️ Visualization Engine  
Interactive charts using Plotly (line, bar, scatter, map, heatmap).

### 5️ Interface Layer  
Deployable via:
- React Web App  
- Slack Bot  
- Colab

##  Dataset Used

**Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**

- ~100k orders (2016–2018)
- Customers, sellers, products, payments, reviews
- Multi-table relational structure

Perfect for testing metadata-driven query generation.

##  Run in Google Colab

### Install dependencies

```python
!pip install langchain cohere plotly pandas sqlalchemy faiss-cpu
```

---

### 3. Clone the repository (if available)
```python
!git clone https://github.com/piyush080205/Schema-Assist.git
%cd schema-assist
```

##  Usage Examples

| User Query | Bot Response |
|------------|--------------|
| *“What columns are in the orders table?”* | Displays table schema with descriptions + sample data |
| *“What’s the average delivery time?”* | “Average delivery time is 12.3 days” + histogram |
| *“Show me order distribution by state”* | Interactive Plotly map of Brazil with bubble sizes |
| *“How have sales trended over time?”* | Plotly line chart with monthly order totals + forecast |
| *“Is there a relationship between price and review score?”* | Plotly scatter plot with trend line |

##  Demo Scenario

1. **Ask**: “What’s in the dataset?” → Agent returns summary of tables and key columns.  
2. **Follow‑up**: “Show me top 5 product categories by sales” → Bar chart of top categories.  
3. **Drill down**: “Now filter to just 2018” → Updates chart with 2018 data.  
4. **Explore**: “Map of customer locations for electronics” → Geographic map of electronics orders.  
5. **Analyze**: “Correlation between freight cost and review score” → Scatter plot + trend line.
